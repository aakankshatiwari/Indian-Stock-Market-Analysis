In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis divided into four key sections:

1. Market Overview – A general snapshot of the Nifty 50 index, highlighting key financial indicators, stock trends, and market behavior over the last two decades.
2. Volatility Analysis – Focused on analyzing stock volatility, identifying the most and least volatile stocks, and examining how volatility has impacted overall index performance.
3. Stock Performance – Comparing individual stock performance within the Nifty 50, including the best and worst-performing stocks, and analyzing how these have influenced portfolio returns.
4. Portfolio Strategy – A strategic analysis of stock selection and portfolio construction based on historical data, volatility, and return potential.

Stock Insights – A detailed breakdown of stock performance by key metrics (returns, volatility, growth potential), highlighting key trends and opportunities for portfolio optimization based on the data.
